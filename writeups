pdf:
  - make resume repo public and host pdf as gh-page, access it via url: not good because public
  - somehow download/access the artifact from private repo (github api, with credentials)
    - using github api to get pdf, asset download wont work becuase of authorization of private repo
    - nextjs api: getserversideprops
    - using release for now, maybe can use artifacts
    - https://github.com/hsteinmueller/resume/releases/latest/download/resume_en.pdf
  - ended up removing react-pdf and just using <object>, much nicer and with controls, no extra download and pages buttons needed
    
secret:
  - keep it in source?
  - during build time:
    - github_token is only for repository
    - personal access token as secret: ${{ secrets.pat }}
      - workflow and nextjs build can access this during build (works for static)
      - add hook to rebuild gh-pages when new release on resume
      - OR: save env during build time? it has to be saved in the source this way... hashed? (https://github.com/formatlos/next-env)
    - if its static anyway, i dont need to fetch it from the other repo? and can keep it as static asset, would be faster too
    - maybe i can trigger a workflow with the file as static asset from resume repo?
